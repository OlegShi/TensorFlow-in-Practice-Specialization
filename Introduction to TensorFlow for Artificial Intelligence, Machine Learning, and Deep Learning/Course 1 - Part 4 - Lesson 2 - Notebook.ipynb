This gave an explicit example of learned behavior. Of course, in that instance, it was a bit of overkill because it would have been easier to write the function Y=2x-1 directly, instead of bothering with using Machine Learning to learn the relationship between X and Y for a fixed set of values, and extending that for all values.\n","\n","But what about a scenario where writing rules like that is much more difficult -- for example a computer vision problem? Let's take a look at a scenario where we can recognize different items of clothing, trained from a dataset containing 10 different types."]},{"metadata":{"id":"H41FYgtlHPjW","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Start Coding\n","\n","Let's start with our import of TensorFlow"]},{"metadata":{"id":"q3KzJyjv3rnA","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"7a1ceed7-66f6-4a43-b3f4-26d54bd95817","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1550587660097,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":1577,"user":{"displayName":"Laurence Moroney","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RcxktLY-TBk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/b4V4dTIqmPI/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"06401446828348966425"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","print(tf.__version__)"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["1.13.0-rc1\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"n_n1U5do3u_F","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The Fashion MNIST data is available directly in the tf.keras datasets API.
